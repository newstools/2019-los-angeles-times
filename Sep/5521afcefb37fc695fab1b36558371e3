Lynley had numerous guest appearances on television series including “Fantasy Island,” ’'The Love Boat” and the original “Hawaii Five-O.” “She loved working in film and much as she loved going to the movies,” Selsman said in an email. She said her mother took her to all sorts of films when she was a growing up. Selsman, who has her own video production company, described her mother as “bon vivant” and as someone who “loved to dance, going to the ballet, seeing anything on Broadway.”  Lynley, who was born in New York on Feb. 13, 1942, started her career as a child model. She was profiled by Life magazine and appeared on its cover when she was 15 and starring in “The Potting Shed” on Broadway.
